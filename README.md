angel-PS1 - The Angel's Prompt
==============================


`angel-PS1` is your guardian angel for the Unix world.


The implementation is a
[*daemon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29),
a background process, that will service your shell every time it needs to
display the prompt.

This is a daemon, but not a nasty demon. So it is an angel. Like a
guardian angel, attached to the shell and who gives him precious
information about the world around that you can't see. You'll not see him,
but he is there. Always around, but always discreet.

### Basic usage

Try this in `bash` to get a fancy prompt with the default settings:

    wget https://github.com/dolmen/angel-PS1/raw/master/angel-PS1
    chmod u+x angel-PS1
    eval `./angel-PS1`

**Note:** this project is still very young and is constantly evolving. I
recommend to *not yet* load it from `~/.bashrc`.

### Features

**Note:** The API is not yet complete. So, some of this content is still
pure vaporware marketing ;)

Angel's Prompt is not just another new fancy prompt for your Unix shell.
This is also:

* **A powerful, but still fast, prompt.** Thanks an original architecture,
  you are not limited anymore by the speed of your shell and the cost of
  forking processes.
* **Not just *my* prompt, but *your* prompt.** You can configure your own
  look using plugins.
* **A prompt written in Perl.** The powerful companion to your administration
  tasks, but also an expressive general programming language.
* **A prompt building framework.** The API will help you to easily build your
  own prompt using plugins, and to build plugins that you'll share with others.
  With a powerful engine that allows you to easily specify colors and to
  transparently handle escape shell special characters.
* **[CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) power.** Thanks to Perl and its community,
  you have access to the thousands of Perl modules on the CPAN to efficiently
  and/or portably retrieve information that you will show in the prompt.
